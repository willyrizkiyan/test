This project will discuss the prediction of trip duration using a <b>regression model</b>, 
more specifically, <b>new york taxi trip duration</b>. This project retrieves data from 
<a href = https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data>https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data</a>. 
The objective of this project is <b>to improve customer service and 
encorage the customer </b>to use yellow medallion taxis by providing estimated travel time. 
Based on modeling, the <b>decision tree regressor model</b> was obtained as the best model with 
a mean absolute error and root mean square error of 165 and 218 or it can be said 
to have an <b> estimated average error of 2.8 minutes </b>.

New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing

for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines) , 
commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. Over 200,000 TLC licensees total approximately

1. <b>Convenience</b>: Request a ride through a mobile app, track the driver's location in real time, and easier to budget for the rides. <br>
2. Transparency: See the driver's profile, can leave their own rating and feedback, help increasing secure and confident. <br>
3. Availability: More readily (especially in suburban and rural areas). <br>
4. Cost: Depending on the location and the specific ride. <br>
<br> Focus on the convenience part, namely the main advantage of HVFHV is that it is easier for the customer to budget for the rides, 
where this determination is made in advance by knowing the trip duration. <br>

1. Better Route Planning: lead to more efficient and faster trips by taking into account the expected travel time and any potential delays. <br>

3. Increased Safety: reducing the likelihood of drivers speeding or taking unnecessary risks to make up for lost time. <br>
4. Better Customer Satisfaction: reducing uncertainty and anxiety for passengers. <br>

Best model: Decision Tree Regression <br>
Hyperparameter: max_depth = 15, max_feature = 15 <br>
RMSE = 217.7 <br>
MAE = 164.6 <br>
An error in the model predicts a trip duration of only 2.8 minutes. <br><br>
The following is the feature importances value of each feature that 
most influences the trip duration: <br>
1. pickup_latitude = 0.41 <br>
2. dropoff_latitude = 0.24 <br>
3. pickup_longitude = 0.15 <br>
4. dropoff_longitude = 0.12 <br> <br>
It can be interpreted that the pick-up and drop-off points are the features 
that most influence the trip duration. As for vendors and store and forward flags 
as well as pick-up times, they do not have a large influence on the trip duration
